# scRNA-seq-CWGPM-22
This repository contains the jupyter notebook for the hands-on tutorial on scRNA-seq data analysis using scanpy conducted at CSIR-IGIB.

The workflow includes steps from PREPROCESSING till CLUSTER ANNOTATION (Both Manual and Automated) of scRNA-seq data (3k PBMC data from 10X Genomics)

The code has been majorly adapted from https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html with additions, modifications and insights from our side
