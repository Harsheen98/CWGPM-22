# scRNA-seq-CWGPM-22
This repository contains the jupyter notebook for the hands-on tutorial on scRNA-seq data analysis using scanpy conducted at CSIR-IGIB.

The workflow includes steps from PREPROCESSING till CLUSTER ANNOTATION (Both Manual and Automated) of scRNA-seq data (3k PBMC data from 10X Genomics)

The code has been majorly adapted from https://scanpy-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pbmc3k.html with additions, modifications and lots of insight such as explanations for codes, visualisations and various concepts pertaining to single cell data analysis in general wherever possible and needed.

We hope the notebook can serve as a thorough guide for anyone starting out their journey of using scanpy for analysing scRNA-seq data!
